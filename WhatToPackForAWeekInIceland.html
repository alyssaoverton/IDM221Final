<h1>What To Pack For A Week In Iceland</h1>
    <h3>April 7, 2017</h3>

<p>
        Before my study abroad trip to Reykjavik, the professor running 
        the program told our entire group to pack and dress in layers. 
        She also told us to pack fairly lightly, which REALLY confused me 
        and made my packing that much worse. Typically, I like to consider myself 
        a solid packer. I always do it last minute – as in a few hours before I have to 
        leave. But somehow, I always manage to pack everything I need and a little 
        more to be safe. However, for some reason I didn’t pack nearly enough clothes 
        for this trip and to make things worse, the clothes I brought weren’t even warm 
        enough to withstand Iceland’s crazy weather. </p>

<p>   Since I’ve lived in Upstate New York my entire life, I know exactly what true cold weather feels like. 
    I’ve dealt with the terrible snow storms, icy roads and chilling wind and somehow I was still unprepared 
    for the weather I experienced during my week stay in Iceland. My first tip on packing would definitely 
    be to bring as much waterproof gear as possible. And don’t even bother bringing an umbrella. 
    None of the locals used umbrellas when I was there, and to be completely honest the wind is so 
    strong some of the time it would just turn your umbrella inside out and drag you down the street. 
    Anyways, waterproof clothing/coats are SO important because it rains so randomly in Iceland. It could 
    be a bright, beautiful sunny day and in a matter of minutes it could start down pouring. I know this because 
    it actually happened to me while walking to one of the Design March events. Yes, I showed up pretty damp
     and the walk there was completely miserable – but would have been a little better if the coat I had on was 
     waterproof. I was wearing one of those knee-length down puffer coats that are pretty much worn only when 
     genuinely necessary because its so freaking cold outside. If you don’t have a waterproof coat, at least find 
     one that is water resistant and maybe invest in a waterproofing spray. I personally didn’t do this, but other 
     people on my trip did. The next thing I will stress is to definitely dress in layers and do your best to overpack. 
     When I was packing for this trip I was trying to pack “layers” while also packing light, which ended up in me 
     packing a ton of light layers. The heavier & more layers you have the better, especially if you’re out sightseeing 
     all day. You can always take layers off when the sun comes out and leave them in your car or on the tour bus. 
     But even then, it may be good to pack extra layers in your bag just in case it gets colder throughout the day.
        Lastly, I think the most obvious important item to pack other than a coat is a few good pairs of shoes. I went
         on this trip mainly for Design March & the Reykjavik Fashion Festival so I had to have fashion in mind 
         while packing. I brought black knee-high leather boots, a waterproof pair of hiking boots and an older pair 
         of sneakers. I definitely wish I had brought one more pair of fashion boots, but like I said before I was
          trying to pack as light as possible. I used a water resistant lotion on my leather boots before leaving on the
           trip and they lasted fine the entire trip & did not get ruined so make sure if you have a nice pair of shoes you 
           want to wear, weather proofing them is a must. Depending on what you’ll be doing during your stay in 
           Iceland will determine if this article was actually helpful or not!! But if you’ve made it this far, I have 
           compiled a list of Iceland essentials down below:

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Extremely warm socks (tech/thermal, wool, fleece)</li>
<li>Waterproof jacket/coat</li>
<li>Hiking shoes and sneakers</li>
<li>Waterproofing spray</li>
<li>Gloves (preferably the tech ones so you can take photos on your phone without having to take your gloves off)</li>
<li>Sunglasses</li>
<li>Bathing suit (for the Blue Lagoon)</li>
<li>Granola bars (you will thank me later)</li>
<li>Portable charger (some of the touristy day trips last quite literally ALL day so its best to have one on hand)</li>
<li>An extra towel (Iceland is a very eco-friendly country, many of the hotels only give one towel per person and expect you to 
    use the same one for 2-3 days, so bring an extra if you like to use more than one/prefer a fresher towel)</li>
  </ul>
